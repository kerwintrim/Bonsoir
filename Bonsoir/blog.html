              <p> Bonsoir Haiti aims to positively impact Haiti by helping improve the literacy rate of its people. The goal is to build schools along with facilities and amenities to encourage and uplift children to become the very best versions of themselves. 
                  Compared to other organizations, Bonsoir Haiti aims to maintain its structures and ensure a steady supply of amenities cyclically. This period may be monthly or bi-weekly. By planting and instilling education, values and opportunities in the minds of children, the next generation may be able to break this unfortunate spell Haiti has experienced. 
                  The next generation may be able to reverse the poverty their people have suffered for so long.

                <h3>Farming</h3>
                <p>“Agriculture is our wisest pursuit, because it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, good morals & happiness.” – Thomas Jefferson
                    Haiti possesses one of the highest levels of food insecurity in the world. This means a gross number of the population does not have reliable access to a sufficient amount of both affordable and quality food.
                    Bonsoir believes "if you can teach a man how to farm, he can eat for a lifetime". With this principle in mind, we aim to train these orphans in the art of farming.
                    Bonsoir instill a foundation of farming in them whereby they are able to cultivate common crops like corn, bananas and cassava.
                    Not only will this help eliminate hunger, but it will grant them a skill which they can always use to earn money and provide for their family.
                    For children to become the very best versions of themselves and excel in school and other activities, they must be fed adequately.

                </p>

                <h3>Education</h3>
                <p>Bonsoir is geared towards tending to the seeds of the next generation which are the children of Haiti. 
                    We believe they hold the key to unlocking Haiti’s limitless potential. To do this, the goal is to create solid footing for them intellectually which will allow them to catapault into different disciplines.
                    Firstly, Bonsoir will create facilities that will be powered by solar panels. Since Haiti is in a tropical climate, the amount of solar energy available is boundless. 
                    This will allow classrooms to be powered sufficiently to help children be their very best in the classroom. 
                    In the classroom, we aim to not only help them become literate, but expose them to possibilities they never knew existed.
                    Although the state of Haiti may be in turmoil, the children act as the silver lining in this dark cloud.
                    “It is easier to build strong children than to repair broken men.”
                    – Frederick Douglas
