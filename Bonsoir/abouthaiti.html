              <p> Haiti is a mountainous country known for its delicious cuisine and beautiful beaches. It is located in the Caribbean near to islands such as Jamaica.
                   It has an illustrious history that has acted as a beacon for other countries in its vicinity. Its history of freedom acts as inspiration for all who know it. 
                   Haiti was the world’s first black led-republic as well as the first independent Caribbean state. Although it is a shining example of freedom, its people have taken many a blow since its triumph in the Haitian revolution. 
                   From the crippling  debt they paid to France, a slew of uncivil rest involving dictatorships to the most recent and arguably one of the most devastating disasters in recent times, the 2010 earthquake, the people of Haiti have shown their resilience but they need assistance. 
                   Haiti has a population of 11.4 million and as a result of this, it has a high population density. Coupled with this fact is the country has suffered from soil erosion and a low literacy rate. 
                   A high population density already shows scarcity of opportunities for people but when mixed with those other two facts, Haiti’s people suffer immensely. Haiti is currently classified as a fourth world country.
                    This means Haiti is categorized as one of the least developed nations in the world with a low socio-economic status and low human development index ratings
